1-process_creation.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("This is the child process. PID: %d\n", getpid());
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        printf("This is the parent process. PID: %d\n", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Fork failed!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
       

fork() is used to create a new child process.

After fork(), there are two processes running at the same time: the parent and the child.

The variable pid tells us which process we are in:

pid == 0 → this is the child process.

pid > 0 → this is the parent process, and the value is the PID of the child.

pid < 0 → fork failed.

getpid() returns the process ID of the current process.

The program prints different messages for the parent and the child.



2-file1.c + file2.c (Linker
file1
#include <stdio.h>

void hello() {
    printf("Hello from file1!\n");
}

file2
void hello();

int main() {
    hello();
    return 0;
}
file1.c has a function hello() that prints a message.

file2.c has main() and calls hello().

We compile and link them together like this:

gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program


The Linker does the following:

Combines the object files into a single executable.

Resolves references between files (like the hello() function call in file2.c).

After linking, the program can run correctly and call hello() without errors.

3-simple_program.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("This is a simple program.\n");
    return 0;
}
This is a simple program that prints a message.

After compiling (gcc simple_program.c -o simple_program), we get an executable file.

When we run it, the Loader does the following:

Loads the program into memory.

Loads any shared libraries the program needs.

Prepares the CPU to start executing the program.

You can check which shared libraries are loaded dynamically using:

ldd simple_program


The Loader’s job is to take the linked program and actually make it run on the machine.



The Linker combines multiple object files into a single executable program.

Its responsibilities:

Connecting function calls and symbols between different files.

Preparing the program to run on the system.

Handling external libraries (static or dynamic linking


The Loader is responsible for loading the executable into memory and running it.

Its responsibilities:

Loading the executable into memory.

Loading shared libraries needed by the program.

Setting up the CPU to start execution.

In short: the Loader is the step after linking, where the program finally runs on your machine.
